## Datasets

Our model were trained by using the public avaliable MIDI Classical Music dataset that we have found here: https://huggingface.co/datasets/drengskapur/midi-classical-music . The dataset provides us with MIDI files for composers such as Mozart, Haydn, Beethoven, and more. We specifically utilized the Mozart and Haydn MIDI file for training our Transformer and Diffusion models. The data that we used were accessed in solely for academic and research purposes.

## Third-Party Libraries and Frameworks

### Backend
FastAPI, Uvicorn, PyTorch, mido, Pillow, NumPy, OpenAI API, can see the ```backend/requirements.txt``` to look at the specific versions

### Frontend
React and Node.js to run the dev environment

## AI Assistance

We have utilized AI tools, mainly OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google Gemini between December 8 and December 9 in 2025.

### How These AI Tools Were Used

- To debug errors in our Diffusion and Transformer training notebooks
- Helped improve our code structure and readability
- Has assisted us with web app deployment for the frontend and backend
